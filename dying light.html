    <h3 class="b" >Dying light is  a survival horror video game developed by Techland and published by Warner bros. The game's story
        follows an undercover agent named Kyle Crane who is sent to infiltrate a quarantine zone in a Middle-eastern city called 
        Harran. It features an enemy-infested, open-world city with a dynamic day-night cycle, in which zombies are slow and 
        clumsy during daytime but become extremely aggressive at night. The gameplay is focused on weapons-based combat and
        parkour, allowing players to choose fight or flight when presented with dangers.
