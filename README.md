# GAMER-PHILLY 🎮
### author-Antony Xavio Immanuel

## Aim of the project: 🤔
To explore how HTML and css works, including animations and all other simple stuff

## What's the content about: 🤓
Well, it's all about random famous games like valorant, Naraka-Bladepoint,  
Poppy Playtime and Dying Light :skull_and_crossbones:

## How to run the project: 🏃
So the file named gamerphilly.html is the home page, just run it.. then wait for sometime as the images will take time to load. Then enjoy the lil show 😎

### THIS WAS MY FIRST HTML PROJECT, WHICH DID NOT INVOLVE ANY COPY-PASTING, SO IT MIGHT BE REALLY DUMB IN SOME WAYS. DO BEAR WITH IT :pray:
